## On Standards

Day one at SND Interactives judging and two things are without question. Standards are really fucking important and they're high as hell. I'm humbled by the opportunity to be here and awed by the work I've seen. I had hoped to learn where the bar is and it's been amazing to see the variety in execution, but also to detect some trends in presentation. More to come as I learn what I can share and when. But part of the goal was also to write here. 

***Fun stuff that's come up, aside from the amazing work 
- There's much fun to be had in static
- Katie shared [NPR Visuals'](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2013/02/14/app-template-redux.html) approach to lightweight uptime
- The entire process of judging is being handled by [Joey Marburger](https://github.com/joeymarburger) with a tricked out Wordpress. It's amazing to see how changes are made on the fly and how robust the system is with so many elements and so many people.
- there's [#SNDMAKES Designathon](http://sndmakes.hackdash.org/projects/532c7e64bc4102327b00000a) is going on upstairs
- it's not over yet. 

I'm not going to delete the reference to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as I'll likely need it for now.
